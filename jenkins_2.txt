By default all of the processes that Jenkins will run will by default with THE JENKINS USER ID

The problem with THE JENKINS USER ID as it's initially set up is that it's too restricted for us in order to do most things

cat /etc/passwd | grep jenkins
vim /etc/passwd

### change /bin/false to /bin/bash ###

###
generate ssh key if you need to log into particularly slave nodes or build server you need to have a user ID that you can use for that purpose
###

passwd jenkins
su - jenkins
pwd

ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id jenkins@localhost
ssh localhost


visudo
