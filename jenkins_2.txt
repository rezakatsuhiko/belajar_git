By default all of the processes that Jenkins will run will by default with THE JENKINS USER ID

The problem with THE JENKINS USER ID as it's initially set up is that it's too restricted for us in order to do most things

cat /etc/passwd | grep jenkins
vim /etc/passwd

### change /bin/false to /bin/bash ###

###
generate ssh key if you need to log into particularly slave nodes or build server you need to have a user ID that you can use for that purpose
###

passwd jenkins
su - jenkins
pwd

ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id jenkins@localhost
ssh localhost

visudo 


This isn't strictly necessary if you don't want to have THE JENKINS USER be a NO PASSWORD USER because you can pass it in at the command line if you want
Best practices would indicate you have THE JENKINS USER as PRIVILEGED USER but it still requires a password
 
### add script below root ALL=(ALL)	ALL   ###

jenkins ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL

---
At slave node add jenkins user and config the visudo like above
---

ssh-copy-id jenkins@slave.node
ssh jenkins@slave.node
