what does that mean?
because we're running the command in the background there's no terminal for it to display its output too

So in order to display the output so that we can capture it as plain text and allow the shell script because what jenkins is effectively doing is it's taking our console or it's taking our build itself

It's Creating a temporary workspace in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace and it in the temporary directory it's executing a shell to shell out and run an actual shell script contains the commands within our shell build but it doesn't have any TTY in order to run it

By default SSH comes configured with required TTY from SSH configuration file

TTY associated with your log and that's how it grabs the console for being able to print output to the screen

It will not affect your system in any way shape or form. This is just a way of accommodating out ability to run scripts in the background in our jenkins builds.
